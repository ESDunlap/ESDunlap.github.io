In the first main testing of multiplayer, we used Photon was the battle royale project following the zenva tutorials.
In the battle royale we explored the different functions of Photon using [PunRPC] along with photonView
to create a multiplayer royale along with an intro menu

Next, we moved onto Playfab where we learned to authenticate users along with being able to track data they made.
In the zenva tutorial we followed, it led us to make a time based collectathon with a leaderboard.

The final project we had to was to implement both types of online connectivity into a previous project.
For my game, I chose [Memory-Cube](https://github.com/ESDunlap/Memory-Cube). The way I decided to implement
multiplayer was to first, have a leaderboard showing the farthest a player has gotten (due to the hard
nature of the game) and second, include a multiplayer mode where players destroy blocks their allies hit
allowing them to open paths.
